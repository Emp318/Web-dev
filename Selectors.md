CSS selectors are used to find or select the HTML elements you want to style. CSS selectors can be divided into five categories:
1. Simple selectors: select elements based on name, id, class
- element selector: The element selects HTML elements based on the element name. Here, all `<p>` elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color:

- id selector: The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element! To select an element with a specific id, write a hash `(#)` character, followed by the id of the element.

2. [[Combinator selectors]]: select elements based on a specific relationship between them.
3. [[Pseudo-class selectors]]: select elements based on a certain state.
4. [[Pseudo-elements selectors]]: select and style a part of an element.
5. [[Attribute selectors]]: selects elements based on an attribute or attribute value.
