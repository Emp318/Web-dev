CSS selectors are used to find or select the HTML elements you want to style. CSS selectors can be divided into five categories:
- Simple selectors: select elements based n name, id, class
- [[Combinator selectors]]: select elements based on a specific relationship between them.
- [[Pseudo-class selectors]]: select elements based on a certain state.
- [[Pseudo-elements selectors]]: select and style a part of an element.
- [[Attribute selectors]]: selects elements based on an attribute or attribute value.
