A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. For example, it can be used to:
- Style an element when a user moves over it
- Style visited and unvisited links differently
- Style an element when it gets focus
- Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements

### Note: `a:hover` must come after `a:link` and `a:visited` in the CSS definition in order to be effective! `a:active` must come after `a:hover` in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.
