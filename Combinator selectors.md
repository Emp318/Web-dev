A combinator is  something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
A CSS selector can contain one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
There are four different combinators in CSS:
- Descendant combinator (space)
- Child combinator (`>`)
- Next sibling combinator (`+`)
- Subsequent-sibling combinator (`~`)
